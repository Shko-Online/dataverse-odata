# @albanian-xrm/dataverse-odata
This package will help parse OData strings (only the Microsoft Dataverse subset). It can be used as a validator, or you can build some javascript library which consumes the output of this library. 

## UPDATE!
Thanks to @jordimontana82 for telling me about @balena/odata-parser (https://github.com/balena-io-modules/odata-parser) which seems to fit my current use cases very well.
Will be archiving this unless I stumble uppon blocking issues with @balena/odata-parser
