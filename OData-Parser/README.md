# @shko.online/dataverse-odata
This package will help parse OData strings (only the Microsoft Dataverse subset). It can be used as a validator, or you can build a javascript library which consumes the output of this library. We are using this to mock the `WebAPI` on the `@shko.online/componentframework-mock` package.
